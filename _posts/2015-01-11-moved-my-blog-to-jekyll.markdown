I migrate my blog to Jekyll. Before i used WordPress in order to write some
post and keep things up about conferences and other stuffs.

I migrate manually only latest articles but i can confirm that this new blog is
100% compatible with the old WordPress that i have. I configured the same
permalink strategy and Disquss and other stuffs.

Thanks to Github Pages i can skip any hosting problem.
