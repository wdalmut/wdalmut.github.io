Me and Francesco Ficili are working on different Raspberry Pi shields that helps us to solve common problems. The navigation shield add a GPS module and the inertial measurement unit in a stackable format for the Raspberry Pi board.

The shield adds also a couple of LED and connectors in order to expand features with external boards.

In these days i start to debug the shield with different testing software in order to complete the board development. I would like to thank Francesco that design all the PCBs that we are prototyping and for all the time that waste with me working on this kind of things!

Here is the Raspberry Pi Navigation Shield!
